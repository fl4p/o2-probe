/* MCU ADC1 on PA7 (ADC1_IN7) - the independent 3V3A witness.
 *
 * The ADS1119 also measures 3V3A/2 on its AIN2, but the ADS1119's own AVDD IS
 * 3V3A: a converter cannot report its own supply collapsing. PA7 exists so a
 * 3V3A brownout - which silently drops the LMP91000's volatile configuration
 * and therefore the cell bias, with the MCU still happily running
 * (PLAN.md:273-280) - is detectable at all.
 *
 * This ADC's reference is VREF+ = 3V3D, a different rail, so absolute volts
 * come from the factory VREFINT calibration rather than an assumed 3.3 V.
