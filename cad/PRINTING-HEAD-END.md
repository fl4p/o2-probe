# Printing the end-window head — ASA, 2026-09-03

Build file: `exports/head-end-plate.3mf` (all four parts, print-oriented, one file).

    make head-end-provisional

regenerates it along with the per-part STLs and re-runs every gate. Gates green at
the time of writing: both fastening routes render as closed solids, cavity mesh
**4849.2 mm³** against the 5.0 cm³ budget (3.0 % margin).

## What is on the plate

| part | volume | bbox | orientation | support |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| head | 28.4 cm³ | Ø42 × 33.6 | as modelled, well up | none |
| carrier | 5.6 cm³ | Ø39.1 × 9.6 | **flipped, flange down** | none |
| retainer | 2.9 cm³ | Ø39.1 × 3.0 | flat | none |
| cap | 17.6 cm³ | Ø47 × 32.5 | **flipped, nose down** | none |

≈ 54.5 cm³ of solid, so roughly **58 g** of ASA at 1.07 g/cm³ before infill relief.

Both flips exist for a reason and both are load-bearing:

- The **carrier** flange overhangs the spigot by a full 90° all the way round.
- The **cap**'s solid plowing face sits on top of the open cage band. Printed
  nose-up the slicer is asked to start a full Ø47 disc in mid-air on six 3 mm
  ribs — a ~39 mm island. Inverted, the nose is the first layer and the lower
  shell arrives last as a 3.45 mm annulus bridging rib to rib, anchored at both
  ends. Verified on the mesh: the plate's first layer in the cap quadrant is
  Ø39.00, the nose face, not the Ø47 rim.

The head needs no support as modelled — every diameter change going up is either
a shrink (a short annular bridge inward) or the well floor, which is solid
material. The two cap screw holes are Ø2.1 horizontal and self-bridge.

## Slicing — Bambu Lab P1P, 0.4 nozzle, Textured PEI

Profiles that actually apply (there is no `@BBL P1P` ASA profile; Bambu ships the
X1C one and marks P1P compatible):

- machine `Bambu Lab P1P 0.4 nozzle`
- process `0.20mm Strength @BBL P1P` — Strength, not Standard: the O-ring groove
  land and the six threaded bosses want the extra walls. Plus
  `curr_bed_type = Textured PEI Plate`, 5 mm outer brim.
- filament `Bambu ASA @BBL X1C 0.4 nozzle`, **flattened over its inherits chain**
  — see below.

Verified in the emitted gcode: `filament_type = ASA`, nozzle 270 °C, bed 100 °C,
`curr_bed_type = Textured PEI Plate`. **1 h 47 m, 40.67 cm³.**

Two traps, both caught by `~/dev/ee/zoe/enclosure/slice-check.sh` rather than by
reading the profile names:

1. **The CLI defaults to Cool Plate.** The fitted plate is Textured PEI and the
   P1P cannot detect it, so it has to be declared. ASA at a 100 °C bed on a plate
   sliced for Cool Plate is wrong in both directions.
2. **The CLI does not resolve a filament profile's `inherits` chain.** It loads
   only the leaf file's own keys, silently. The leaf sets the *specific* values
   and the parents hold the *general* ones, so the result is a hybrid that exists
   in no profile: nozzle 270 °C (ASA, from the leaf) over a bed at **45 °C**
   (PLA, defaulted) with `filament_type = PLA`. `filament_settings_id` in the
   header still names the ASA profile — the provenance is right while the values
   are wrong. Flatten the chain parent-first and pass one self-contained profile.
   Recorded in `~/dev/kb/3d-print/orcaslicer-cli-does-not-resolve-filament-inherits.md`.

- **Brim.** Three of the four parts are Ø39–47 flat discs. What warps first is
  the carrier flange and the retainer face, which are the two surfaces the seal
  stack clamps against.
- **The P1P is open-frame** unless it has been given an enclosure. ASA on a bare
  P1P will warp on discs this size. If there is no enclosure on this machine, that
  is the single biggest risk to the print, ahead of anything in the geometry.
- **Do not** let the slicer put a seam or a gap-fill artefact inside the Ø27.3
  well or on the flange face. Those are sealing surfaces.

## Support: the answer is none, and here is the evidence

Support was enabled at the minimum useful setting — `normal(auto)`, build-plate
only, 30° threshold, 0.2 mm top gap — and the result sliced and analysed against
the plate layout. It costs +1.88 cm³ and +4 m 38 s, and this is where it goes:

| region | support moves | z | |
|---|---|---|---|
| head | 6283 | 0.20–15.80 | **inside the blind tube socket** |
| carrier | 420 | 0.20–0.80 | first layer under the bore |
| retainer | 10 | 0.20–3.00 | noise |
| cap | 5 | 14.80–15.80 | noise |

94 % of it is a **14 mm column packed inside the head's Ø32.4 blind tube socket**,
put there because the socket roof at z = 14 is a 90° annular ledge and the socket
floor is the build plate, so "build-plate only" does not exclude it. That socket
is a *bonding* surface — the tube glues into it across `bond_gap` — it is blind,
and you cannot reach in to clean it. Everything else support touches is 435 moves
of noise.

The ledge it wants to support is a 4.26 mm radial inward bridge. That is routine.

**So print with support off.** Both files are in `exports/` if you want to compare
in the slicer:

- `head-end-asa-pei.gcode.3mf` ← the one uploaded to the printer
- `head-end-asa-p1p-minsupport.gcode.3mf` (kept only to show what support does;
  sliced before the plate and filament were corrected, so do not print it)

They are gitignored: machine- and material-specific, several MB, regenerable from
the tracked plate.

## What this print does and does not establish

**It is a fit and geometry check.** It establishes the bolt circle, the
flange/retainer stack height, the cap grip and cage, the socket over the tube,
and whether the carrier actually enters the well. That is worth having.

**It does not establish the seal**, and the numbers say so plainly. Running the
model with the carrier printed rather than turned:

| well | carrier | rings | band | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| reamed H7 | machined | catalogue | 12.41 / 15 | PASS (production route) |
| reamed H7 | **printed** | **sorted** | 11.97 / 15 | PASS |
| reamed H7 | **printed** | catalogue | 19.24 / 15 | **FAIL** |
| printed | printed | sorted | 24.88 / 15 | **FAIL** |

So an as-printed pair does not seal, and no O-ring squeeze value exists that
satisfies both ends of the tolerance band. To get a *sealing* prototype out of
printed parts, two things must both happen:

1. **Bring the well to H7.** Ø27.3 H7 is not a stock machine-reamer size; the
   practical route is single-point boring on a lathe, which is diameter-agnostic
   and does not care that 27.3 is an odd number. Moving the well to a stock
   Ø27.5 reamer is *not* a drop-in — it pushes install stretch to 5.17 % and
   trips the 5 % rule, so it would need a different ring ID.
2. **Sort the rings by cord with a micrometer** and use the ones that fit.

Also note the printed-carrier figure of **±0.15 mm on the groove root is my own
estimate, not a measured value.** Route 2 above rests on it. Measuring the groove
root on this very print is the cheapest way to replace that estimate with a fact.

**The ASA carrier cannot carry the membrane.** The PMV15T disc is *welded* into
the production carrier, and the production carrier is machined PP-H for exactly
that reason. ASA is not weldable to PP. Treat the printed carrier as a fit model
of the seal geometry only.

## Still open, and unchanged by printing

- `cell_axial_len = 13.0` is a placeholder. The 3.0 % volume margin rides on it.
- **EPDM ammonia compatibility is unverified**, gating both the O-ring and the
  membrane gasket.
- The membrane gasket is unsourced — material, hardness, thickness, preload.
- The 6 + 2 screws are unsourced, with an unsourced pilot diameter.
